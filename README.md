# Oipie API

Oipie API repository implements the API that will be consumed by the mobile apps.

## üíª I'm a dev, how do I get started?

Prerequisites:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): 3.10
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation): 1.2.0
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)


### Dependency management

We are using virtual environments to manage our dependencies separated from other Python projects. Dependencies are managed using poetry.

```bash
poetry add [--group dev] <package==version> # adds a new dependency
```

If no version is specified, the latest version will be installed with caret, but the caret should be removed. If that is the case, just regenerate lockfile.

```bash
poetry lock # regenerates lockfile
```


### Docker

We use Docker as a utility tool, mainly for running a Postgres, which is the Database that we have deployed with RDS. In the `docker-compose.yml` you have two services:

- `postgres`: A postgres database that we use for starting the API in development mode and running the integration tests locally.
- `web`: Our API running in production mode with [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/).

For starting the full application you can run the following command

```bash
docker-compose up [-d] --build
```

#### :warning: Important warning

If you're using a M1 chipset based computer, you may encounter some problems when interacting to `web` container. The main reason is because some `pip` dependencies regarding `SQLAlchemy`. This can be solved by exporting `DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM` variable to `linux/amd64`:
`export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64` or adding it to your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` or the tool you are using. Another alternative is to simply use Rosetta. Please be adviced that any of these workarounds may make your Docker performance a little bit lower.

## üóÇ How is the repository organized?

In order to be aligned with the Oipie DevOps Team, this repository is organized with the following folder structure:

1. src - contains all source code of the application.
    * api: code all controllers and DTO
    * config: configuration files
    * core: all modules on the application.
    * tests: E2E tests and fixtures
3. .github - Github actions integration for CI/CD

## üèò How is the code organized?

The architecture follows the principles from Hexagonal Architecture.

All the main code of the application lives under `src`

## ‚úÖ Tests

- Unitary Tests are paired with the element that tests. For example `test_recipe.py` is next to `recipe.py`.
- Acceptance tests lives under the `tests` directory.

### CI/CD

Continous integration execute pylint and all tests on each push to any branch.
